File Read & Write Challenge and Error Handling Lab

This project demonstrates a Python program that reads a file, modifies its content, and writes it to a new file while handling potential errors. The program asks the user for a filename, attempts to read the file, and writes a modified version to a new file.

Objectives
- Read a file and modify its content
- Write the modified content to a new file
- Handle potential errors such as file not found or permission issues

Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Built-in Python libraries: input, open, try-except block for error handling

How to Run/View the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Python script using the command python filename.py (replace filename.py with the actual name of the Python script).
4. Enter the filename when prompted.
5. The program will display the content of the file, modify it, and write it to a new file.

Insights or Reflections
This project demonstrates basic file input/output operations in Python and error handling using try-except blocks. It highlights the importance of handling potential errors when working with files to ensure robustness and prevent crashes.
